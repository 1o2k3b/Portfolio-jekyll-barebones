# About Me

I am a 13 year old programmer with the hope of continuing my programming journey throughout high school, and hopefully even after high school, but not even I dare to look that far into the future.
My favorite thing within programming is AI, and I have alreday taought myself linear regression and watcehd through tutorials to learn the basics of machine learning as I really want to learn it.
I enjoy making games in java such as  [my monopoly project in level 2](https://github.com/League-level2-student/league-level2-game-1o2k3b.git ), which took me an inexpressibly long amount of time.

As for my hobbies outside of coding, I love surfing(but hate getting up early to do so!), especially when the wind and swell is just right. I also love skiing, as my mom is swiss so I was introduced into it
at a young age, and loved the sport from the very day that I started it. I also love cooking and I decided to try and learn how after I had the sudden realization that someday I won't have my mom's
cooking and it might be helpful to know how to later. My favorite recipe is a  recipe that I made on christmas day being a[slow red wine saucebraised beef short ribs]( https://www.recipetineats.com/braised-beef-short-ribs-in-red-wine-sauce/ ).
