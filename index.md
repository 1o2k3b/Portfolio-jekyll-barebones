League Student's Awesome Project Page.

One of my favorite projects is a [simple dino jump game I created](./dino.html).
It's a browser-based game where a pixelated dinosaur leaps over obstacles to
score points. While the concept is straightforward, I enjoyed the challenge of
implementing smooth animations and responsive controls. It was a fun way to
practice JavaScript and game design principles.


In my free time, I also enjoy baking, and my favorite recipe is for [homemade
focaccia](./focaccia.html). The process of kneading the dough and infusing it with olive oil,
rosemary, and sea salt is incredibly satisfying. The result is a golden, fluffy
bread that's perfect for sharing with friends or enjoying as a snack.
